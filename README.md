# Checkers-exercise
* Take as input an 8x8 checkerboard (grid). Each square has either a red checker, a black checker, or no checker on it. (These are not placed according to the rules of checkers, but can be placed on any of the 64 squares.) You decide the format and delivery of the input/output.  
* Using your programming language of choice, write a program to evaluate whether there are 4 checkers of the same color (red or black) in a consecutive line anywhere on the board, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
* Write automated tests to verify that your program functions correctly.
